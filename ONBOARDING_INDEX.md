# Lionheart Onboarding UI - Complete Documentation Index

## Overview

Complete onboarding user interface for the Lionheart educational SaaS platform. All files are production-ready, with comprehensive documentation.

**Current structure note:** The first onboarding step now confirms organization, primary school, and primary campus details separately. Campus name, address, type, and grade band are captured through `GET/PATCH /api/onboarding/school-info`; legacy references to a single school-info blob are historical.

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Files Created:** 5 React components + 4 documentation files
**Total Size:** 80 KB code + docs
**Framework:** Next.js 15, React 18, Tailwind CSS
**Theme:** Light (white/blue), fully responsive
